### Set up and run your sample application

In Visual Studio Code, set up and run your bookshop application.

1. Before you start working, fork [this repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-bookshop-wdi5) to your personal GitHub account. See [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
2. In Visual Studio Code, choose **View** **→** **Command Palette…** **→** **Git:Clone**.
3. As **Repository URL**, enter:
    ```URL
    https://github.com/<your github username>/cap-bookshop-wdi5.git
    ```
4. Choose **Select Repository Location** and select a folder into which to clone the test repository.

5. When asked if you want to open the cloned repository, choose **Open**.

    As a result, the `CAP-BOOKSHOP-WDI5` project is loaded into the **EXPLORER** pane and you can see its resources in the outline:

    ![Resources of the project in the explorer pane](FolderStructure.png)

6. In Visual Studio Code, choose **Terminal** **→** **New Terminal**.

7. Execute the following command to install the npm packages:

    ```Shell/Bash
    npm install
    ```

8. Execute the following command to start your bookshop application:

    ```Shell/Bash
    npm run start
    ```

9. To open a new terminal, choose **Terminal** **→** **New Terminal**.

10. Execute the following command to call the quick start installation of wdi5:

    ```Shell/Bash
    npm init wdi5@latest -- --configPath ./app/admin-books/webapp/test/wdi5/ --specs ./**/wdi5/specs/**.js --baseUrl http://localhost:4004/fiori-apps.html\#Books-manage
    ```

    The console output should look as follows:

    ![Terminal response for the 'npm init wdi5' command](wdi5_init.png)

11. In your project in the **EXPLORER** pane, choose **`app`** **→** **`admin-books`** **→** **`webapp`** **→** **`test`** **→** **`wdi5`**.

    Now you can see all files you need to define system tests with wdi5:

    - The `wdio.conf.js` file:

         In this file, you'll define the settings for the wdi5 plugin, for example the browser and reporter, as well as the URL to access the SAP Fiori app under test.

    - The `test.js` file (in this case, it's called `bookshop.test.js`):

         In this file, you'll define your test scenario, which comprises steps that are triggered one after the other. Within the test scenario, you'll refer to your page objects.

    - Page objects (in this case, you have `pageobjects/manageBooks.page.js` for the list of books that are added and the button to create a new book, and `pageobjects/newBook.page.js`  to provide the details of the new book):

        Page objects are design patterns that represent a significant part of an app, for example, a view. They group two kinds of elements:

           - Actions, for example, choosing the **Create** button to create a new book
           - Assertions, for example, checking if the newly created book is displayed in the list of books

         Page objects reside in the `pageobjects` folder of your project. They use locators to identify specific elements on the screen and thereby, allow test runners to see and do anything a real user would.

12. Execute the following command to install the timeline reporter:

    ```Shell/Bash
    npm run install --save-dev wdio-timeline-reporter
    ```

    The console output should look as follows:

    ![Terminal response for the 'npm install --save wdio-timeline-reporter' command](wdi5_install_timeline_reporter.png)

13. In the `wdio.conf.js` file, add the following snippets to configure the timeline reporter and the Chrome browser:

    ```JavaScript
    const { TimelineService } = require("wdio-timeline-reporter/timeline-service");
    exports.config = {
    // ...
    ```

    ```JavaScript
    // ...
    services: ['chromedriver','ui5', [TimelineService]],
    // ...
    ```

    ```JavaScript
    // ...
    reporters: ['spec',[
        "timeline",
        {
            outputDir: "target",
            embedImages: true,
            screenshotStrategy: "before:click",
        },
        ]
    ],
    // ...
    ```

    ```JavaScript
    // ...
    capabilities: [{
        maxInstances: 5,
        browserName: 'chrome',
        acceptInsecureCerts: true,
        "goog:chromeOptions": {
            args: ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-dev-shm-usage"]
        }
    }],
    // ...
    ```

14. Now, your project setup is ready. Make sure that your code looks as follows and choose **File** **→** **Save**.

    ![wdio.conf.js after finishing the project setup without comments](confjs.png)



### Walk through the test scenario

Familiarize yourself with your test scenario before starting to code it. Later, you'll automate the following steps so that they are automatically executed during your system tests.

1. As your bookshop application runs on your local server, use the following URL to access it:

    ```URL
    http://localhost:4004/fiori-apps.html#Books-manage
    ```

2. In the bookshop application, choose **Create**.

    ![Create button in bookshop app](CreateButton.png)

3. Enter the title of your new book, for example, `How to Cook Pancakes`.

4. From the **Genre** drop-down menu, choose **Fiction**.

5. From the **Author** drop-down menu, choose **Emile Bronte**.

    ![Title of the new book](EnterTitle.gif)

6. Choose **Create**.

7. Verify that the **Edit** button is displayed.

8. Choose **Back** to return to the list of books.

9. Verify that the new book has been added to the list.

    ![New book in the list](NewBook.png)

    The created book will persist as long as the local server with the application is running. To start with a fresh database, stop the process and restart it with `npm run start`.



### Create a test for adding a new book

Create a wdi5 script to test the creation of a new book in your bookshop application.

1. In your project in the **EXPLORER** pane, choose **`fiori`** **→** **`app`** **→** **`admin-books`** **→** **`webapp`** **→** **`test`** **→** **`wdi5`** **→** **`specs/bookshop.test.js`**.

    The `bookshop.test.js` file contains your test scripts, which are divided into two sections:

    - The describe block, which is like a test suite and holds sets of test cases that are called `it`
    - The `it` block, which comprises the test cases

    You can have multiple `it` blocks in a single spec file.

    In your `bookshop.test.js` file, you'll define the steps of your test scenario and within them, refer to your page objects.

2. Into the `describe` function, implement the `it` function by adding the skeleton of the `create new book` test:

    ```JavaScript
    it("create a new book", async () => {

    });
    ```

    Your code should now look as follows:

    ![bookshop.test.js with create new book test](techedSpec.png)

3. As a first step to create a new book, you have to choose the **Create** button. Implement this action as follows in the `it` block:

    ```JavaScript
    await ManageBooksPage.iClickOnCreateNewBook();
    ```

    Here, `iClickOnCreateNewBook()` is a reference to the test function that you'll define in the following.

    Your code should now look as follows:

    ![Action to choose the create button](iClickCreateButtonAction.png)

    After each step make sure to save your changes by choosing **File** **→** **Save**.

4. From the **EXPLORER** pane, open `pageobjects` **→** `manageBooks.page.js`.

    This file represents the page object for your bookshop application. In page objects, you can define actions that are performed during a test and make assertions:

    ![Structure of page objects](manageBooksPO.png)

5. In the bookshop application in Google Chrome, press **CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **ALT** + **T** (if you use a Windows system) or **SHIFT** + **CTRL** + **OPTION** + **T** (if you use a Mac system) to open the Test Recorder in a new browser window.

6. In your sample application, right-click on the **Create Button** and choose **Press**.

    As a result, the Test Recorder highlights the entry to indicate its activity:

    ![Test recorder highlights the create button](CreateButtonPress.gif)

    Now, the Test Recorder provides a code snippet for your test:

    ![Test recorder provides code snippet for wdi5 test](SelectDialectwdi5.png)

    >**Note:** Make sure that the dialect `wdi5` is selected.

7. Copy the generated code snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `manageBooks.page.js` and name the function `iClickOnCreateNewBook`.

    ![Clicking the create button action in the manageBooks page object](ClickCreateButtonLogic.png)



### Create a test for adding detailed information to your book

Create a wdi5 script to test the addition of detailed information to your newly created book.

1. From the **EXPLORER** pane in Visual Studio Code, open `bookshop.test.js`.

2. In the describe block, add the following line to declare the variable `bookTitle` and assign the value `"How to Cook Pancakes"` to it:

    ``` JavaScript
    const bookTitle = "How to Cook Pancakes";
    ```

3. When adding detailed information to a book in the bookshop application, as a first action, you have to enter the title of the book. Implement this action as follows in the `it` block:

    ``` JavaScript
    await NewBookPage.iEnterTitle(bookTitle);
    ```

    The `bookTitle` constant, which you have declared before, is passed as an argument, here.

    Now, your code should look as follows:

    ![booksho.test.js with enter title action](EnterTitleSpec.png)

4. From the **EXPLORER** pane, open `pageobjects` **→** `newBook.page.js`.

5. In your bookshop application, right-click the **Title** input field and choose **Enter Text**.

    As a result, the Test Recorder highlights the input field to indicate its activity:

    ![teched.spec.js with enter title action](EnterTitle3.gif)

    Now, the Test Recorder provides a code snippet for your test:

    ![The test recorder provides a code snippet for the enter title action](wdi5_EnterBookTitle.png)

    >**Note:** Make sure that the dialect `wdi5` is selected.

6. Copy this code snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `newBook.page.js` and name the function `iEnterTitle`.

    Here, pass the `sBook` as an argument in the function name and use it in the `enterText()` method.

    ![Code snippet for enter title action in newBook page object](EnterTitleSnippet.png)

7. In the `it` block of your `bookshop.test.js`, add the following line to choose a value from the **Genre** drop-down list:

    ``` JavaScript
    await NewBookPage.iSelectGenre();
    ```

    ![Code snippet for select genre action in bookshop.test.js file](SelectGenreSpec.png)

8. In your bookshop application, right-click the **Genre** drop-down menu and choose **Press**.

    As a result, the Test Recorder highlights the drop-down icon to indicate its activity:

    ![Highlighted genre drop-down menu](ClickGenreDropDown.gif)

    Now, the Test Recorder provides a code snippet for your test:

    ![The test recorder provides a code snippet for the genre drop-down menu](GenreDropDownSnippet.png)

    >**Note:** Make sure that the dialect `wdi5` is selected.

9. Copy this code snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `newBook.page.js` file and name the function `iSelectGenre`.

    ![Code snippet for select genre action in newBook page object](GenreSpecs.png)

10. From the **Genre** pop-up window in your bookshop application, right-click **Fiction** and choose **Press**.

11. Again, the Test Recorder provides a code snippet for your test. Copy it into the `module.exports` section of your `newBook.page.js` file under the same function name (`iSelectGenre`).

    Your code should now look as follows:

    ![Final code in newBook.page.js after adding the steps from the genre drop-down and pop-up](SelectGenerVSCode.png)

12. In the `it` block of your `bookshop.test.js` file, add the following line to choose a value from the **Author** drop-down list:

    ```JavaScript
    await NewBookPage.iSelectAuthor();
    ```

13. Repeat the procedure for selecting the author (that is, copying the generated code snippets from the Test Recorder for choosing the drop-down menu and **Emily Bronte** from the pop-up window into your page object). Name the functions `iSelectAuthor`.

    In the end, the code in your `newBook.page.js` should look as follows:

    ![newBook.page.js after adding the steps from choosing the author](CodeSnippetChooseAuthor.png)

14. In the `it` block of your `bookshop.test.js`, add the following line to select the **Create** button at the bottom of the application:

    ```JavaScript
    await NewBookPage.iPressCreate();
    await NewBookPage.iSeeEditButton()
    ```

15. Now, at the footer in the bookshop application, right-click the **Create** button and choose **Press**.

16. Copy the generated snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `newBook.page.js` file. Name the functions `iPressCreate` and add the expected behavior to your `bookshop.test.js` file.

    ![newBook.page.js after adding the code snippet for pressing the Create button](ClickSaveBtnSnippet.png)

17. To ensure that the saving action was successful, verify that the **Edit** button is displayed. Add the expected behavior to your `bookshop.test.js` file:

    ![bookshop.test.js after adding the code snippet for verifying that the edit button is displayed](EditButtonAssertion1.png)

18. In the bookshop application, right-click the **Edit** button and choose **Highlight**.

19. On the right side of the Test Recorder window, you can find a section with **Properties** and **Bindings**. Choose the icon that is located on the left of the property `enabled`. This will add `expect(enabled).toBeTruthy();` to the code snippet.

    ![Code snipped with property "enabled"](EnabledButton.gif)

20. Copy the generated code snippet from the Test Recorder into the `module.exports` section in your `newBook.page.js` file and name the function `iSeeEditButton`.

    It should look as follows:

    ![Page object after adding the code snippet from the test recorder](EditButtonAssertionPO.png)

21. Let's proceed with our test scenario by implementing another `it` function in the `bookshop.test.js` file. To achieve that, we need to add the skeleton of the `should check book is added` test function:

    ```JavaScript
    it("should check book is added", async () => {

    });
    ```

22. In this `it` function, we need two steps. First an action to navigate back to the list of books and a second step to assert that our newly created book is contained in the list. Implement this as follows in the `it` block:

    ```JavaScript
    await NewBookPage.iNavigateBack();
    await ManageBooksPage.theBookListContains(bookTitle);
    ```

    Now, your test is complete. Make sure that it looks as follows:

    ![Complete test in newBook.page.js](TechedspecFile.png)

23. To get the code snippet for the implementation of the `NewBookPage.iNavigateBack` action, right-click the **<** *(Go Back)* button and choose **Press** in the bookshop application.

    ![Test recorder highlights the navigate back button](BackButton-PressEvent.gif)

24. Again, copy the generated code snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `newBook.page.js` file and name it `iNavigateBack`.

    Your page object should now look as follows:

    ![Page object with action for pressing the back button](BackButtonVSCode.png)

25. In your bookshop application, choose the **<** *(back)* button. As a result, you should see the list of all books including the one you've added.

26. In the list of books of your bookshop application, right-click the title of the book you've created and choose **Highlight**.
    
    >**Note:** Make sure that only the specific title of the row is highlighted in blue and not the whole row.

27. On the right side of the Test Recorder window, you can find a section with **Properties** and **Bindings**. Choose the icon that is located on the left of the property `visible` in the `Inherited` section. This will add `expect(visible).toBeTruthy();` to the code snippet.

    ![Test recorder highlights the book entry](Title-HighlightEvent.gif)

28. Copy the generated code snippet into the `module.exports` section of your `manageBooks.page.js` file and name the function `theBookListContains`. Here, pass the `sBook` as an argument in the function name and use it in the locator to identify the control by its text.

    It should look as follows:

    ![Page object after adding the code snippet from the test recorder](NewBookisInList.png)

29. Choose **File** **→** **Save**.

30. Right-click your `test\wdi5` folder in the **EXPLORER** pane and choose **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

31. Execute the following command to run your test:

    ```Bash/Shell
    npm run wdi5
    ```

    If your test run was successful, your terminal response should look as follows:

    ![Terminal output after successful test](TerminalOutput.png)

    You might face a timeout error as shown in the following screenshot:
    
    ![error snippet from console for step timeout](cucumbertimeout.png)
    
    The timeout property is applicable at each step definition. However, if you want to increase the timeout because your test takes longer than the default value, you need to set it in the mocha framework options. In the `wdio.conf.js` file, set the time as follows:
    
    ``` JavaScript
    // wdio.conf.js
    exports.config = {
        //.....
        mochaOpts: {
            ui: 'bdd',
            timeout: 60000
        }
        //.....
    }
    ```

    Another known timeout error is while waiting for the UI5 controller to load as shown in the following screenshot:

    ![error snippet from console for ui5timeout](waitforui5error.png)
    
    If you are getting timeout errors while waiting for an UI5 element to load, consider increasing the maximum waiting time for the availability of UI5 control. In the `wdio.conf.js` file, set the time as follows:
    
    ``` JavaScript
    /// wdio.conf.js
    exports.config = {
        //.....
        wdi5: {
            waitForUI5Timeout: 60000,
        },
        //.....
    }
    ```

32. In the **EXPLORER** pane, right-click the `timeline-report.html` in the `target` folder and choose **Reveal in File Explorer**.

33. Double-click the `timeline-report` in the file explorer:

    ![timeline-report.html in the file explorer](ReportHtml.png)
